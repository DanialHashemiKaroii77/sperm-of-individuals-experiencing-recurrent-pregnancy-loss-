Investigating the interaction of nuclear receptor transcription pathway genes in the sperm of individuals experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss by weighted correlation gene network analysis and single-cell sequencing

Abstract:
Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and impaired spermatogenesis are complex reproductive disorders with poorly understood genetic mechanisms. This study analyzed RNA sequencing data from 20 RPL cases and 20 controls, identifying 45 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to the nuclear receptor transcription pathway (18 upregulated, 27 downregulated). Key DEGs included SMAD3, NCOR2, CTNNB1, HIF1A, and PPARA, with SMAD3 and HIF1A upregulated in RPL, and NCOR2, CTNNB1, and PPARA downregulated.
A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified four modules, with the brown module (n=809 genes) strongly linked to autophagy (r = -0.91, p < 0.05). Enrichment analyses revealed involvement in sperm motility, cilium assembly, transcription regulation, and pathways like IL-4/IL-13 signaling, SMAD2/3 phosphorylation, and RORA-mediated expression.
To validate findings, single-cell RNA-seq on 40 testicular samples revealed five cell clusters and transcriptomic heterogeneity in impaired spermatogenesis. Expression of SMAD3 and HIF1A was upregulated, while NCOR2 and CTNNB1 were downregulated, consistent with their roles in germ cell differentiation and testicular function.
Further, miRNA analysis identified regulators (e.g., miR-151-3p, miR-3144-3p) potentially modulating key genes post-transcriptionally.
Conclusion: Integrative transcriptomic and scRNA-seq analysis highlights SMAD3, NCOR2, and HIF1A as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in RPL and impaired spermatogenesis.
